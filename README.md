# Algorithm Performance Tracking Dashboard

The Algorithm Performance Tracking Dashboard is a streamlined tool designed to track the performance of an algorithm that utilizes Selenium to scrape odds for matches from different bookies daily. The algorithm then calculates the expected value and applies the Kelly criterion to determine favorable betting opportunities.

## Features

- Scrapes odds for matches from various bookies using Selenium.
- Calculates the expected value (EV) for each match based on the scraped odds.
- Applies the Kelly criterion to identify betting opportunities with a positive expected value greater than 0.03.
- Provides a user-friendly dashboard to visualize and track the algorithm's performance over time.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides an intuitive interface to monitor the algorithm's performance. Here's an overview of the main sections:

- **Summary**: Provides a snapshot of key metrics, including the ROI,total number of bets per day, and overall profit/loss.

- **Performance Metrics**: Offers detailed performance metrics, such as win rate, and return on investment (ROI). These metrics help evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness.

- **Historical Data**: Presents historical data in the form of charts and tables, allowing you to analyze the algorithm's performance over time. Visualizations may include line charts, bar charts, or other formats to represent various aspects of the algorithm's performance.

- **Betting Opportunities**: Highlights the specific matches and betting opportunities identified by the algorithm, including the expected value and recommended bet amount based on the Kelly criterion.

## Customization

The dashboard can be customized to suit your preferences and reporting needs. You can filter the information by league, market and EV.
